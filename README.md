This portfolio project because it was built using SASS. Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

### Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet

- SASS is an abbreviation for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
- Sass is an extension to CSS
- Sass is a CSS pre-processor
- Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
- Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time
- Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006
- Sass is free to download and use

## Why use SASS
Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.

Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.

## How it works 
A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass pre-processor to convert Sass code into standard CSS.

This process is called transpiling. So, you need to give a transpiler (some kind of program) some Sass code and then get some CSS code back.

# Install Sass
There are several ways to install Sass in your system. There are many applications that will get you up and running with Sass in a few minutes for Mac, Windows, and Linux. Some of these are free, but some are paid apps.

You can read more about them here: sass-lang.com/install
